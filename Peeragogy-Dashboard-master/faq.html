                                                       Perhaps have a look at our "Co-facilitating" and "Co-working" pages for some inspiration, and our "Examples"
                                                       and "Activities" for some concrete suggestions.  If you already have a learning group, consider ways in which 
                                                       your group can usefully connect with others.  Also, please consider that the Peeragogy Handbook was made by people like you 
                                                       -- you can always practice peeragogy by joining our community and helping us improve the book.  Even if it's just a comment here and there 
                                                       -- tell us about what works for you, and what doesn't.

                                                    The patterns, heuristics, and use cases discussed on our Patterns page show how individual problem solving 
                                                    behavior is related to collective problem solving.  Platform designers need to take both individual and collective
                                                    action into account.  Our Coworking page provides some further perspective on this.  (You may also want to look at the Convening a Group page,
                                                     since Coworking picks up where Convening a Group leaves off.)

                                                     At the end of our essay describing the move "From Peer learning to 'Peeragogy'", we say: 
                                                      "Rather than 'reproducing the system', this sort of open-ended descriptive-design process 
                                                      can be used by learners to identify the topics and ideas of concern to them, as well as to build their own language, 
                                                      and their own set of social roles, to talk about and devise methods for addressing issues of concern."  
                                                      It would probably be good to start with that page, and use it together with your group in a collaborative design exercise.  
                                                      We also provide some thoughts about "Researching Pæragogy", where we connect paragogy principles with a general approach to measuring and supporting learning.

                                                     thing to apply to any given environment. So it's difficult if other
                                                     people, different from us, try to impose rules or define things

                                                     organizations. I think they could gain a lot if they understand
                                                     that peeragogy is a better way to work in an entrepreneurial
                                                     or private environment, in general, I think it's good for all.

                                                 <li>That's a good question. I've been thinking more about how
                                                     you create a culture of peeragogy. It can tend to be a natural extension of the way in which people behave. If the
                                                     culture/environment is created around a group of people they will tend to participate in that way. I'm not sure if you say I
                                                     wanna do peeragogy I'm not sure how to respond to that actually. Except I'd want a loose structure, I'm not sure.
                                                 </li> 
                                                 <li>I think I do a lot of peeragogy and I'm very happy about it because I learn so much from my group and from myself in this
                                                     group that I like to apply it to other projects that I'm in or all the co­working/co­living projects or anything basically. Especially
                                                     the principle of mutual respect that is still remaining after  a very long time. And the really nice relating to each other. <
                                                     The main principle is mutual respect and openness, mutual space not constrained by time/space. And the process. And
                                                     what I meant by the details, in each detail there is value that we promote.
                                                     Let's say how we manage the Peeragogy Page or Community (See “How to Get Involved”. These seem to be details,  
                                                      but they're actually really important. So if we pay attention to all these, every little thing matters, and this is how I do it. I try to be very careful about basically everything.

                                                     I love the concept of peeragogy. It combines networking, learning and collaboration and elevates them to a whole new level or platform, 
                                                     one that I think membership organizations could apply. After all, if your members have identified interacting with their peers, sharing real-life
                                                     experience and case studies as key reasons for joining your organization, then introducing some peer-based learning sessions might be worth a try.

                                                     In today’s hyper-active social media world, many of us, especially “digital natives” such as Millennials are used to information gathering and 
                                                     knowledge sharing online. This generation doesn’t want to be lectured to, they want “transformative experiences.” 
                                                     While some Millennials may not be sold on the importance of face-to-face networking, they regularly seek peer feedback and trust the recommendations 
                                                     and insight offered via social media networks. This leads me to believe that younger members would welcome a learning experience that involves enabling 
                                                     them to share opinions and brainstorm solutions – whether online or off.

                                                     Here are a few ideas for integrating the peeragogy concept in your organization:
                                                     <li>
                                                     <strong> “Elevate our conference and education participants to co-learners with the presenters and facilitators.” </strong>
                                                     This is a key suggestion that Jeff Hurt makes in his post. He advises conference organizers to “[shift] from the traditional 30-, 60- or 90-minute lecture” 
                                                     and “provide 10-minutes of content followed by 10-minutes of pair-shared discussion. Keep the peer-learning in small pairs or triads so everyone feels engaged.” 
                                                     </li>
                                                     <li>
                                                     <strong> “Harness member insight”</strong> (suggested by one of the comments to Jeff Hurt’s post) – by providing an opportunity for some sort of audience interaction in all conference, 
                                                     seminar and workshop sessions. Make this a requirement for all of your speakers. 
                                                     </li>
                                                     <li>
                                                     <strong>Peer training:</strong> I’ve seen this concept applied in the workplace, where trainers taught employees counselling and life-saving skills and those folks, in turn, offered training to their colleagues. 
                                                     Perhaps peer-to-peer learning could be applied to help train fundraising volunteers at non-profits or help volunteers learn member or volunteer recruitment and management skills? This kind of peer training process 
                                                     could help with volunteer transitions and orientation.
                                                     </li>
                                                     <strong>Facilitated networking activities</strong> for example, if you’ve identified some key issues or challenges facing your members, you could organize a facilitated discussion or forum where members could offer their insight on how they’ve handled the issue/challenge.
